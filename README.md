## 📊 Project Overview

FraudScout is an advanced fraud detection system designed to identify and prevent anomalies in financial transactions. This project leverages cutting-edge technologies and machine learning algorithms to provide real-time monitoring, analysis, and reporting of potentially fraudulent activities.

## 🚀 Key Features

- Real-time Transaction Monitoring: Watch transactions as they occur and get instant alerts on suspicious activities.
- Advanced AI-powered Detection: Utilize Random Forest algorithm for accurate fraud detection.
- Interactive Dashboard: Visualize transaction data, trends, and risk assessments through dynamic charts and graphs.
- CSV Data Analysis: Upload and analyze CSV files containing transaction data for comprehensive fraud detection.
- Customizable Rules: Set up and fine-tune detection rules to fit your specific needs.
- Risk Scoring: Assess the risk level of each transaction based on multiple factors.
- Responsive Design: Fully responsive web interface for seamless use across devices.

## 🛠️ Technology Stack

### Frontend
- React.js with Next.js
- UI Components: shadcn/ui
- Animations: Framer Motion
- Charts: Recharts
- CSV Parsing: Papa Parse
- Icons: Lucide React

### Backend
- Python
- Flask
- Scikit-learn (Random Forest algorithm)
- Pandas for data manipulation

## 🚦 Getting Started

### Frontend Setup

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/fraudscout.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the frontend directory and install dependencies:
   ```
   cd fraudscout/frontend
   npm install
   ```

3. Run the development server:
   ```
   npm run dev
   ```

4. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.

### Backend Setup

1. Navigate to the backend directory:
   ```
   cd fraudscout/backend
   ```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
   ```
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. Install required packages and run the Flask application:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   python app.py
   ```

The backend server will start running on [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000).

## 🔍 How It Works

1. **Data Ingestion**: The system accepts CSV files containing transaction data through the frontend interface.

2. **Data Preprocessing**: The backend uses Pandas to preprocess the data, ensuring it matches the required format for the machine learning model.

3. **Feature Scaling**: The StandardScaler is applied to normalize the input features, improving the model's performance.

4. **Prediction**: The Random Forest model (loaded from `model.pkl`) analyzes the preprocessed data to identify potential fraudulent transactions.

5. **Results**: Predictions are sent back to the frontend, where they are displayed in an interactive dashboard with various visualizations.

6. **Real-time Monitoring**: The system continuously processes new transactions, providing instant alerts for suspicious activities.

### API Endpoints

- `GET /`: Health check endpoint
- `POST /predict_csv`: Endpoint for predicting fraud from a CSV file
  - Accepts a CSV file upload
  - Returns JSON with predictions for each transaction

### Dashboard Components

- Transaction Summary
- Risk Assessment Chart
- Real-time Transaction Feed
- Fraud Detection Trends
- Customizable Alert Settings

## 📈 Future Improvements

- [ ] Implement user authentication and authorization
- [ ] Add more advanced machine learning models (e.g., Neural Networks, XGBoost)
- [ ] Develop a mobile app version
- [ ] Integrate with popular payment gateways
- [ ] Implement real-time notifications (email, SMS)
- [ ] Add support for multiple languages and currencies
- [ ] Create a comprehensive test suite
